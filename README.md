# OverTheWire-Bandit
This repository documents my progress through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame, a hands-on cybersecurity challenge designed to teach fundamental Linux and command-line skills. 

My goal is to learn the basics of linux and applying them to challenging problems.  
  
## About Bandit
Bandit is aimed at beginners to Linux and security. It focuses on learning by doing — each level introduces a new concept that must be applied to obtain the password for the next level.

## Skills Developed
- Linux command-line usage (Bash)
- File system navigation and manipulation
- Permissions and special file attributes
- Text processing tools (e.g. grep)
- Networking basics and remote access
- Problem solving in constrained environments

## After Thoughts
This was a great experience in learning the command line and using this tool to weave my way through various challenges that require research to be done through man pages or wikipedia pages recommended in the hints from the problem page.  
It taught me to find my own solution, and man pages excelled in developing my skill in reading through documentation. Some pages were what I thought to be miles long, gave in actuality, concise instructions and helpful examples for all the different options and variations that can be used through a certain command. It was mind blowing and very satisfying when completing levels as it gave me the power to do everything myself without giving me too much information in the hints.  
I am deeply grateful for this free resource and encourage anyone to do these challenges, even without any prior knowledge or even interest in cybersecurity or the linux command line.
